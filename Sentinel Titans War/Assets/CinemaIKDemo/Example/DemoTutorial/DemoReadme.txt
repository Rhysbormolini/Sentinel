This is a simple demo showcase. Man in a suit is sitting in a front of a laptop and drinking his delicious coffee, after a deep sip he nods his head to the camera. To see that just hit play or select "Timeline" object and open "Timeline Window" and hit play.

The character model uses simple sitting animation without any movements at all. All movements produced by CinemaIK. As the CinemaIK uses anchors, you can place the script on a separate object and animate it as you want.
